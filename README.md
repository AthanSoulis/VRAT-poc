# VRAT-poc

This repository showcases the VRAuthoringTool developed for my thesis ["Automatic tool for translating 2D structured stories to 3D virtual environments"](https://pergamos.lib.uoa.gr/uoa/dl/object/2073253) (available in Greek only).

This experience set in the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük is a proof of concept on how a story structured to be experienced on a 2D medium, such as a smartphone's screen, could be translated to exist in a 3D virtual environment such as GoogleVR.

When translating the 2D structured story to the 3D virtual environment the VRAT exposes certain options to the user via a UI. 
The main objectives for this UI were :
* [to be non-intrusive but accessible](https://youtu.be/pHOsO_mswgE)
* [to give the ability to the user to move around the environment](https://youtu.be/IOE4fbJWPi0)
* [to let the user make a choice on the branching sections of the story](https://youtu.be/6goE-wvB3XY)

You can download the [CatalVR.apk](https://github.com/AthanSoulis/VRAT-poc/blob/main/CatalVR.apk) in order to install the experience in your Android phone.
Gyroscope and a fairly new mobile processor is required.
